# Keyboard-case-files

Based on laser cut case created by ademy (https://github.com/ademey/cervello) this is a 3D printed version that looks more like the Apple M0110 keyboard.

I designed the case for Mechvalult.net Cerebral PCB, but case will also work with Neuron and Schwann PCBs that used the original Neuron gasket style mount plate. you want to use some foam (2mm or so) between the plate and case for tight fit.

Case is held together using 6 M3 standoff glued to top case (recommend 6mm to 11mm) and 6 M3 screws (Recommend 10mm to 12mm but 5mm can work if your standoff is long enough). The screw cutout on bottom case will fit a countersunk washer but some sanding might be required based on printer resolution.
